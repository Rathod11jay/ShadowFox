        "\n",
        "**Matplotlib** is a fundamental Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive plots. It is inspired by MATLAB's plotting capabilities and offers a highly customizable interface for a wide range of chart types. It serves as the backbone for many other visualization libraries and provides fine-grained control over every aspect of a plot.\n",
